### Preset System

The CXM 1978 has **30 preset slots** organized in **3 banks of 10 presets each**:

- **Bank 1**: Presets 0–9 (left LED off)
- **Bank 2**: Presets 10–19 (left LED red)
- **Bank 3**: Presets 20–29 (left LED green)

**Saving Presets:**
- Send CC 27 with value 0–29 to save current state to that slot
- Example: `CC 27, Value 5` saves to preset 5
- You can also press and hold the SAVE stomp switch on the pedal

**Recalling Presets:**
- Send **Program Change 0–29** to recall the corresponding preset slot
- Example: `PC 4` loads bank one, preset four; `PC 17` loads bank two, preset seven; `PC 20` loads bank three, preset zero
- Motorized faders will move to show the preset's saved positions

**Jump Button:**
- **Off** (1): Normal preset scrolling
- **Jump to 0** (2): Preset footswitch skips to preset 0
- **Jump to 5** (3): Preset footswitch skips to preset 5

### MIDI Channel

The CXM 1978 defaults to **MIDI channel 2**. To change it:
1. Hold both stomp switches while powering on the pedal
2. Release when the seven segment display lights up
3. Send a Program Change message on the desired channel
4. The pedal sets itself to that channel permanently

## Parameter Descriptions

### Faders

**Bass**: Controls the decay time of low frequencies in the reverb tail. Higher values extend bass decay, creating a boomy, cavernous character.

**Mids**: Controls the decay time of mid frequencies. Adjusting the balance between Bass and Mids creates the characteristic vintage reverb timbre.

**Cross**: Sets the crossover frequency that divides the bass and mids decay paths. Lower values place the crossover deeper in the bass range; higher values push it into the lower mids.

**Treble**: Adjusts the high frequency content of the reverb output. Lower values darken the tail; higher values add brightness and air.

**Mix**: The wet/dry blend. At 0 the signal is fully dry; at 127 it is fully wet. Most settings sit between 30–80 for a natural reverb balance.

**Pre-Dly**: Adds a short delay before the reverb tail begins. Even a small amount of pre-delay separates the dry signal from the reverb, improving clarity and definition.

### Reverb Type (CC 23)

**Room** (1): A tight, natural room reverb. Shorter, realistic decay with a focused early reflection pattern.

**Plate** (2): Recreates the smooth, dense character of a physical reverb plate. Smooth build-up with an even, sustained tail — great for vocals and snare.

**Hall** (3): A large concert hall reverb. Long, diffuse decay with a broad stereo image and a classic 70s studio sound.

### Diffusion (CC 24)

Controls the density of early reflections in the reverb:

- **Low**: Sparse, distinct early reflections — more of a "slap" feel before the tail
- **Med**: Balanced density — general-purpose diffusion
- **High**: Dense, smooth build-up — the reverb blooms quickly with no distinct early reflections

### Tank Modulation (CC 25)

Adds pitch modulation to the reverb tank (recirculation path):

- **Low**: Subtle shimmer — a gentle, slow chorus-like movement
- **Med**: Noticeable modulation — classic 70s tape-style warble
- **High**: Deep, lush modulation — dreamy, expansive movement

### Clock (CC 26)

Selects the internal clock quality of the reverb engine:

- **HiFi**: Clean, modern-sounding reverb with full bandwidth
- **Standard**: The classic CXM character with slight bandwidth limiting
- **LoFi**: Reduced bandwidth and bit depth for a grungy, vintage character — think old drum machine reverb

## AUX Control

Connect a Meris Preset Switch with a TRS cable to the Aux port. Toggle between Preset mode and Performance mode by holding the Jump arcade button while inserting the TRS cable.

**Preset Mode**: Switches 1–4 recall presets 1–4 in the current bank.

**Performance Mode**:
- Switch 1: Move faders to expression heel position (press again to return to preset)
- Switch 2: Move faders to expression toe position (press again to return to preset)
- Switch 3: Instantly kill the reverb tail (buffer clear)
- Switch 4 (1st press): Lock sustain — blocks dry signal, maxes reverb tails
- Switch 4 (2nd press): Gracefully clear the buffer with a fade out

## Expression Pedal Setup

The CXM 1978 supports expression pedal control over any combination of faders. Configure expression directly on the pedal:

1. Enter expression setup menu
2. **E Page**: Move faders up (on) or down (off) to assign to expression
3. **T Page (Toe)**: Set fader positions at full expression
4. **H Page (Heel)**: Set fader positions at zero expression
5. Exit to save

Each preset can have its own expression assignment, or you can configure a global expression setting shared across all presets.

## Tips & Tricks

### Room Ambience
- Type: Room, Diffusion: Low, Mix: 20–40, Pre-Dly: small amount
- Creates a natural, transparent room that adds depth without drawing attention

### Classic Plate
- Type: Plate, Bass: 60, Mids: 80, Cross: 60, Diffusion: Med, Tank Mod: Low
- Smooth, full-sounding plate that sits well under guitars and vocals

### Large Hall
- Type: Hall, Bass: 80, Mids: 90, Cross: 50, Diffusion: High, Tank Mod: Med
- Expansive, evolving hall reverb in the 70s studio tradition

### Modulated Ambience
- Type: Plate or Hall, Tank Mod: High, Clock: Standard
- The modulation creates a lush, chorus-like shimmering quality

### LoFi Vintage
- Type: Room or Hall, Clock: LoFi, Diffusion: Med
- Grunge up the reverb for a vintage drum machine or tape saturation character

## Troubleshooting

**Faders not moving:**
- Motorized faders automatically update when recalling presets via MIDI. Ensure the preset is fully loaded before expecting movement.

**Arcade buttons not responding:**
- Arcade buttons use values 1–3 (not 0–127). Verify the correct value range.

**Preset save not working:**
- Ensure CC 27 value is 0–29. The pedal saves the current knob positions from the hardware faders.

**MIDI channel mismatch:**
- Default MIDI channel is 2. Verify Librarian is connecting on channel 2, or change the pedal's channel as described above.
